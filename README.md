# User research - UX/UI

## Explanation of the project

Website design to learn and understand **user research** in **UX** and **UI**.

We have tried to make these explanations accessible to everyone by using several learning methods :

- Motion design
- Downloadable PDF
- Web site

We have taken into account good accessibility practices for the creation of this website.

You can find the work [here](https://neoxazrot.github.io/user-research-ux-ui/) or by downloading the directory.

## Use

So you can choose your favorite way of learning to best understand user research.

In addition, you have the possibility **to sort** the different user search techniques according to duration and complexity.

User search will no longer hold any secrets for you!
